# Project Overview
>The primary objective of our team is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict future safety levels for different London Boroughs. <!-- The aim of this effort is to enhance safety in London neighbourhoods through efficient resource allocation and by making relevant information available to residents. -->

Achieving this objective would require a detailed analysis of data related to various factors that can impact safety, such as past crime rates, demographic information, economic indicators and others. 

The aim of the analysis is to gain insight on:
1. Understanding the overall trends and patterns of crime in London Boroughs.
2. Identifying the specific crime types that are most prevalent in the city.
3. Analyzing correlation with population density and with a number of tourist attractions in each Borough.
4. Examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime rates and understanding any resulting shifts or changes in criminal behavior.
5. Uncovering any unique factors or insights that could contribute to a deeper understanding of crime dynamics in the city.
6. Making final data preparation and suggestions prior the data modeling.

# EDA Definition and Steps

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a versatile data analysis tool that can help us better understand the relationships between dataset variables. This can often be done through data visualisation methods. This makes it easier to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions. 

The process of data analysis involves organising and summarising the raw data, discovering important features and patterns in the data, and interpreting the findings.

Some outcomes of EDA:

- Extracting averages, mean, minimum, and maximum values can help us better understand variables.
- We can use the data to identify obvious potenital errors, outliers, and missing values.
- Identify patterns in data by visualising it in graphs. For example, box plots, scatter plots, and histograms can help us see patterns in the data.

In this summary, I will focus on the steps of EDA. I will explain what each step is and what it involves.:

- Data head and describe data (viewing data and its statistical information)
- Target distribution (this is the distribution of crime data)
- Features distribution (this is the distribution between the features)
- Correlation matrix (this is a table that displays the correlation coefficients between different variables)
- Positive correlated features
- Uncorrelated features
- Negative correlated features
