# EDA Definition and Steps

Exploratory data analysis is a method used by data scientists to investigate and summarize the characteristics of data sets. This can often be done through data visualization methods. The data science tool helps determine how best to use data sources to get the answers we need. This makes it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

EDA is a versatile data analysis tool that can help researchers and developers better understand the relationships between data set variables. The EDA techniques can help you determine if the statistical techniques you are considering are appropriate for the data you are working with.Originally developed by American mathematician John Tukey, these techniques are still widely used today in the data discovery process.

The process of data analysis involves organizing and summarizing the raw data, discovering important features and patterns in the data, and interpreting the findings.

Some outcomes of EDA:

- Extracting averages, mean, minimum, and maximum values can help us better understand variables.
- We can use the data to identify obvious potenital errors, outliers, and missing values.
- Identify patterns in data by visualizing it in graphs. For example, box plots, scatter plots, and histograms can help us see patterns in the data.

In this summary, I will focus on the steps of EDA. I will explain what each step is and what it involves.:

- Data head and describe data (viewing data and its statistical information)
- Target distribution (this is the distribution of malignant and benign data)
- Features distribution (this is the distribution between the features)
- Correlation matrix (this is a table that displays the correlation coefficients between different variables)
- Positive correlated features
- Uncorrelated features
- Negative correlated features

# Step 1: Data Gathering

The dataset we are looking at can be found on ~MPS / OMIS / etc: [link](https://www.link.com/link)
```
# Read data
data = pd.read_csv('../../data.csv')
```
Describe shortly steps for initial cleaning and my reasons for it.

# Step 2: Head and describe

```
# Head
data.head(10)
```
![Data head] -> image

```
# describe
data.describe()
```
![Data describe](-> image)
